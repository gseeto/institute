<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>It is often stated that there is no shortage of capital or ideas, but that we have a drastic shortage
of leaders. The response to this has been a deluge of books and courses on how to lead.
However, we live in a culture that is structured around accumulating knowledge but ignoring
mechanisms to really find out who we are.</p>
<p>Peter Drucker has stated that of the thousands of students that he has worked with, many knew
what to do ... but very few knew who they were. Our belief is that it is more important in the long
run to know who you are - than to know what to do.
</p>
<p>LEMON Leadership is not a "How to" of leadership, but "Who are you?" It looks at leadership in
a fresh way.</p>
<p>If you are a good leader you will lead out of your identity. It doesn't matter too much what your
style, academic background or ethnicity may be. The key is to know what type of leader you
are. This assessment is based on Brett Johnson's book, LEMON Leadership, where he writes
about five types of leaders:</p>

<p>
Have you ever wondered why others see life so differently from you? Do you suspect that
others do not grasp reality like you do? Do you understand who you are, and that it is important
for others to be different? Do you understand how others, even your spouse and close friends,
see life? Does the way other people approach a situation confuse, irritate, or exasperate you?
In your work environment, do you think that you are the only one really working? Do you feel
that your contribution is not appreciated? Do you get frustrated with how things are done, or not
done? Do you frustrate others? Do you experience people getting touchy or defensive about
things that, from your perspective, are not that important?
</p>
<p>
Have you had breakdowns in communication? Have you given instructions that are not properly
understood, and batons that are dropped, or handovers that are not completed?
In your organisation - where are you in the current life-cycle? Do you have the right leadership
mix for this stage of your corporate life-cycle? What about the next stage? Are the right staff
joining? Are the wrong staff leaving? Do you know who you need and how to identify them?
If these are questions you are grappling with, then we believe that LEMON Leadership can
assist you and your teams to be more effective and create the right impact in your organisations
and with the people that you work with. Remember! You lead out of your identity.... who you
are! Not your style, preference or temperament, but your DNA wiring..... your type.

<h2>A brief look at LEMON Leadership</h2>
<p>There are 5 types of leaders, and all of us are a combination of the 5 types. When we do
coaching we look at these in detail, but here is the summary:</p>
<br>The <b>Luminary</b> lives in the world of Ideas and asks the question ... Why?</br>
<br>The <b>Entrepreneur</b> lives in the world of Opportunities and asks the question ... Why not?</br>
<br>The <b>Manager</b> lives in the world of Systems and asks the question ... How?</br>
<br>The <b>Organizer</b> lives in the world of Tasks and asks the question ... What?</br>
<br>The <b>Networker</b> lives in the world of Connections and asks the question ... Who?</br>
<h3>LEMON Leadership looks at ...</h3>
<ul>
	<li>How each LEMON defines reality</li>
	<li>Their starting point for everything that they do</li>
	<li>Who they gravitate towards, and who they ignore</li>
	<li>What each one defines as "Work"</li>
	<li>How they approach life, and everything that they do</li>
	<li>What they focus on</li>
	<li>Their depth of vision</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we have looked at each LEMON type in detail, we move on to see how they interact with
one another. We look at, discuss and workshop ...</p>
<ul>
	<li>Their strengths and weaknesses</li>
	<li>What they protect under pressure</li>
	<li>What they hold on to, and what they let go easily.</li>
	<li>How they communicate - what they mean when they all say the same thing and it means 5
different things</li>
	<li>How they handle confrontation and correction</li>
	<li>How they relate and behave in a team</li>
	<li>How they are on a good day, and how they are on a bad day</li>
	<li>What is important and unimportant to each one</li>
	<li>How to "twist the LEMON". i.e. - How to adapt to different circumstances
We get to understand what is on their radar</li>
</ul>
<h3>Understanding LEMON Leadership can help you ...</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Understand who you really are as a leader
Understand who your colleagues or fellow leaders are and how their 'identity' affects the way
they lead, communicate, handle conflict, etc
Understand certain "Lemon Truisms" about your leadership
Gain an appreciation for your and others leadership DNA and the dynamics this creates at
an individual, team and organisational level
Communicate with your prospective clients, clients and suppliers in a way they understand
</ul>

<h2>Your Personal Profile and Report</h2>

<h3>Watch out for the Weaknesses of your 2nd Slice</h3>
<p>Unlike other leadership models, we do not believe you can avoid weaknesses, but you do need to know that on
a bad day you will exhibit the weaknesses of your secondary slice.</p>
<h3>Good Day - Bad Day</h3>
<p>Pressure or stress has a marked influence on our behavior. We behave, respond or react differently according to
our circumstances. At the same time we all have strengths and weakness. We exhibit our strengths and
weaknesses according to the circumstances that we find ourselves in.</p>
<p>You will need to read the book "LEMON Leadership" or attend the LEMON Leadership course to get a full
understanding of what this means, but put simply - on a Good Day, when there is not pressure and all is right
with the world, I live in the strengths of my Primary Slice. However, on a Bad Day, when the pressure is on, I
live in the weaknesses of my Secondary Slice.</p>
<p>Having bad days is normal, but living in the weaknesses of my Secondary slice is unhealthy. Understanding
LEMON can help you understand what is happening when you are having a bad day. It can also help you, and
others around you, constructively deal with the situation.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer:</h3>
<p>There are caveats that accompany this report. It is important that the user acknowledges the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The LEMON profile is the product of extensive observation over many years. It is focused on the
norm, but there will always be exceptions.</li>
	<li>This is not a psychological profile, and has not been benchmarked against psychological profiles.</li>
	<li>It is not meant to place you in a box with no means of changing. The purpose is to help you
understand yourself and those around you so that you can respect and honour those who are
different from you, and so that you can grow.</li>
	<li>The report is based on the perceptions of the person completing the survey, which perceptions, by
their nature, are subjective. This is not empirical evidence. The accuracy of this assessment is
determined by your understanding of the questions and the veracity of your answers.</li>

	<li>This is just a small percentage of the profile - just a taste. In order to understand your full profile you
would need to read the book "LEMON Leadership" or attend LEMON Leadership coaching.</li>
	<li>LEMON Leadership is simple in concept but complex in its application because it is one piece of a
large puzzle that makes up who we are. Besides acting or reacting because of our LEMON slice,
there are many others reason why we behave like we do. LEMON Leadership is just another layer of
understanding that helps us understand who we are.</li>
	<li>At the end of the day it is our MATURITY (or lack of it) that has the biggest impact on our behaviour.
There is no right or wrong in how we are wired, but our level of maturity will determine how well we
manage our strengths and weaknesses. LEMON Leadership will help you identify destructive
patterns in your life so that you can manage them better.</li>
</ol>
